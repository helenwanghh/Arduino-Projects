### Arduino-Projects

Here is a portfolio of all the Arduino Projects I've done. 

You may find some lab coursework contents, which are the documents when I first time experienced Arduino IDE. You may find some personal projects I'm exploring by myself recently. All the projects are open sources. I find Arduino projects are powerful and fun. Enjoy!
